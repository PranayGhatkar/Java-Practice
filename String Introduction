Problem 13:
String Introduction

Statemet:
"A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable." 
Wikipedia: String (computer science) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_%28computer_science%29

The elements of a String are called characters. 
The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.

Given two strings of lowercase English letters, S1 and S2, perform the following operations:
 1. Sum the lengths S1 of S2 and .
 2. Determine if S1 is lexicographically larger than S2 (i.e.: does S2 come before S1 in the dictionary?).
 3. Capitalize the first letter in S1 and S2 and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Sample Input:
hello
java

Sample Output:
9
No
Hello Java

Solution:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

 

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
                Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s1 = sc.next();
        String s2 = sc.next();
       

        // Sum the lengths of s1 and s2
        int lengthSum = s1.length() + s2.length();

        // Determine if s1 is lexicographically greater than s2
        boolean isS1Greater = s1.compareTo(s2) > 0;

        // Capitalize the first letter in s1 and s2
        String capitalizedS1 = s1.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + s1.substring(1);
        String capitalizedS2 = s2.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + s2.substring(1);

        // Print the output
        System.out.println(lengthSum);
        System.out.println(isS1Greater ? "Yes" : "No");
        System.out.println(capitalizedS1 + " " + capitalizedS2);


    }
